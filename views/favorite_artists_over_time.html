                        The Plotly graph below shows your {{ subheader_message }} top artists. Spotify calculates your favorite
            artists in three time frames and they're displayed in three columns in the chart:
    <li>Left column - these are your all time 50 favorite artists which were compiled from even several years
            <li>Middle column - these are your favorite artists in the last six months
            <li>Right column - your favorite artists from the last four weeks
<br>
        For long and medium term there are fifty artists but for the short term Spotify calculates maxmium 20 artists.
    In the graph below you can hide and show the artists by clicking on the legend and you can see whether some artists
    have fallen out of favor with you, continue to be your top artists or others which became your favorites recently.
